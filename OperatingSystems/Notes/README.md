# Operating Systems Notes

These are my random notes on operating systems in general. There may be some notes more related to some systems vs others but they are meant to be ideas related to operating systems in general. If I create notes that are more related and detailed to a specific system then I will create a seperate folder for them inside of the `OperatingSystems` folder.

## What is an operating system?

An operating system is a layer of software that manages all of the components of a computer and provides a base for all of the other software.
